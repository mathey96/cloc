<br/>output format of numbers were generated by

<br/>seq 0 9 | figlet

<br/>header files:
<br/>echo -e "standard\nlean\nmini\nmono9\nmono12\nsmmono12\nsmscript\nsmshadow\nsmslant" | parallel 'seq 0 9 | figlet -f {} > {}.h' &&
<br/>echo -e "standard\nlean\nmini\nmono9\nmono12\nsmmono12\nsmscript\nsmshadow\nsmslant" | parallel ' echo ":" | figlet -f {} >> {}.h'
